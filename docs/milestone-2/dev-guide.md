** How to help us in develop "The Architect"**

1. Download godot. Godot is an open source game development engine that can be downloaded [here](https://https://godotengine.org/download/windows.

2. Clone the repo into your local folder by using the command ``git clone https://github.com/bharathcs/quantum-defence.git``

3. Open the godot game engine and select the clone repo to import. Edit as you please. All tscn files are automatically updated by godot when you change the scenes. Godot is the only dependancy and you should be able to run everything. Do make a PR to us if you would like to contribute to the project in the future
