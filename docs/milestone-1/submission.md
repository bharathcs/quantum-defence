# Milestone 1 README

## Motivation:

From Google’s claim of already achieving quantum supremacy to IBM’s Qiskit offering to one day give companies API access to their own quantum computing runtimes, there is a lot of exciting news and headlines that still seems almost mystical. However, a lot of the material online is either difficult to digest and not for those without a physics background or they are fluffy pop science articles. We want to take the time to really understand how this works, and try our hand at some quantum computing concepts.

## Aim
Our aim is to make a game that both explains quantum principles, is fun to play, and gets us (as developers) familiar with game development and quantum computing.

## Core features

Defend the base against waves of attacks by enemies with turrets, gates, borders and strategy. This tower defence game will have enemies, defences and structures in superposition or in their measured state. The enemies and items can be in one of 2 states, visually coded as red or blue. When they spawn, they appear in superposition until their state is measured, which happens when they take damage. These basic tower defence functionality is the first set of core feature, and this part is functionally similar to coding for multiple types of damages / enemies in our tower defence game (imagine a tower defence game with elements)

Towers need to be upgradeable, and can potentially be imbued with quantum logic to impact enemies without collapsing the superposition. This is our second set of core feature, to write quantum circuitry and deploy it on our upgraded towers to impact enemies and move them from one state of superposition to another. This moves it well beyond the realm of traditional tower defence game and requires Qiskit integration.

Some of the structures and game mechanics will be simplifications of techniques used in real life quantum computing, such as entanglement and quantum state manipulation (e.g. with Hadamard gates). Over the course of the gameplay, gamers should be able to learn these concepts and be more comfortable with them, even if they do not understand quantum mechanics. This may involve additional educational info in pop ups.
