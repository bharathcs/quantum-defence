# Quantum Defence (Orbital Project)

_Defend the base against waves of attacks by enemies with turrets, gates, borders and strategy.
Along the way, learn more about how these mechanisms are inspired by real life quantum computing applications._

A tower defence game with enemies, defences and structures in superposition or in their measured state. 
The enemies and items can be in one of 4 states, visually coded as red, green, blue or yellow.
When they spawn, they appear in superposition until their state is measured, which happens when they take damage.

Some of the structures and game mechanics will be simplifications of techniques used in real life quantum computing, such as entanglement and quantum state manipulation (e.g. with Hadamard gates).
Over the course of the gameplay, gamers should be able to learn these concepts and be more comfortable with them, even if they do not understand quantum mechanics.
